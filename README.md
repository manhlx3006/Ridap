# Ridap

A location-based app that allow user choose 2 locations by tapping to screen, then drawing route + calculate distance + calculate ETA between 2 locations

This simple application was made when I first joined Grab - A Singapore-based technology company that offers ride-hailing, ride sharing and logistics services through its app in Southeast Asian nations (just to play around with Maps)
